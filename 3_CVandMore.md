My name is Veronica and I am an aerospace Engineer with (almost) a Ph.D. in computational astrophysics. I have specialized in astrodynamics, numerical simulations, mathematical optimization, and machine learning, but my range of interests is broad so I am also very interested in chaos, complex systems, earth observation and nature, photography, technical drawing, and fantasy novels. 

I enjoy scientific programming for complex problems such as spacecraft trajectory optimization to very unserious applications (check my algorithm for a couple's group Secret Santa).
