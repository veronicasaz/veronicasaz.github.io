### Optimization algorithm comparison of a spacecraft trajectory to Mars (2020)
A determining factor in the success of an interplanetary mission is the calculation of the mass of
fuel that is needed. In order to increase the payload mass that can be carried, the mass of fuel
must be reduced.

I compared the efficiency of different optimization methods to reduce the mass of fuel required for the transfer while ensuring the constraints are met.

See the full report with the explanation of the method and a comparison of optimization methods for a simplified version of the problem and a more complex one in [Report](docs/optimization_report.pdf).
